# Archived Solution Artifacts

These folders and files are archived to keep the repository focused on the live Hugging Face chatbot demo. Nothing was deleted.

Contents:
- `architecture/` — original end-to-end architecture docs
- `docs/`, `documentation/` — extended guides and runbooks
- `fabric/` — Microsoft Fabric lakehouse and warehouse schemas
- `integrations/`, `api-integrations/` — external API integrations (Shopify, FedEx/UPS, Stripe)
- `power-automate/`, `power-virtual-agents/`, `power-apps/` — Power Platform assets
- `azure-openai/`, `azure_openai/` — classification and response modules
- `deploy.ps1` — legacy deployment script

Restore or reference as needed; the live demo runs from `app.py` at repo root.
